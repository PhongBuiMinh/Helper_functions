## 🗂️ REPOSITORY

| Command        | Superpower |
|----------------|------------|
| `git init`     | Creates a `.git` directory in the folder and turns it into a Git repo—start a fresh repository. |
| `git remote add` | Links your local repository to a remote URL (e.g., GitHub, GitLab). |
| `git clone`    | Copies the entire setup (commits, branches, files) from a remote repo into your machine. |

## 🌿 BRANCH

Branches are generated by default when creating a new repository.

### Types
```bash
git branch       # Shows local branches
git branch -r    # Shows remote branches
```

### Configuration
```bash
git branch -M main                # Rename current branch to 'main'
git branch -m master main         # Rename branch 'master' to 'main'
git checkout -b new_branch        # Create and switch to a new branch
```
Equivalent to: `git branch new_branch` + `git checkout new_branch`

### Operation
```bash
git branch -d branch-name               # Delete local branch
git push origin --delete branch-name   # Delete remote branch
```

## 🌍 Local vs Remote Branches

| Concept       | Local Branch       | Remote Branch         |
|---------------|--------------------|------------------------|
| Location      | Your machine        | Remote server (e.g., GitHub) |
| Created By    | `git checkout -b`   | `git push` from local  |
| Shared?       | No (until pushed)   | Yes (visible to others) |
| Updated By    | `git commit`        | `git push` / `git fetch` |

---

## 🚀 PUSH

### Typical workflow
```bash
git status
git add changes
git commit -m "your message"
git push -u repo_alias branch
```

---

## 📦 SUBPUSH

### Split and push a subdirectory
```bash
git subtree split -P path_to_directory -b new_branch_name
git push new_remote new_branch_name:main
```
Creates a subtree split for the directory and pushes that split as a separate branch named `main`.

---

## 🔄 REQUEST

### Non-intrusive: fetch updates
```bash
git fetch
```
Grabs new commits from the remote without merging—like observing quietly.

### Full update: fetch + merge
```bash
git pull
```
Brings remote changes into your current branch—fetches and merges together.

## 🏁 Repository Creation Examples

### Option 1: Create a new repo and push
```bash
echo "# Mini_talk_42" >> README.md
git init
git add README.md
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add repo_alias repo-url
git push -u repo_alias main
```

### Option 2: Push an existing repository
```bash
git remote add repo_alias repo-url
git branch -M main
git push -u repo_alias main
```
